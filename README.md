Generic documents on node gains and things we can do


The three step process:
1. Node gains + one or several methods to adapt them
    --> once we have this working, we can implement the sym reg benchmarks
2. time series handling
    --> we can tackle on the of the kaggle problems that deal with time series
3. specific funcions to evolve Neural Networks (sigmoid, reLu) and specifically, Recurrent NNs
    --> now we can compete with Deep Learning ;-)
